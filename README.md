# CS408-DiSUcord
This is the course project of the CS408-Computer Networks course at SabancÄ± University, for the Fall 2023-2024 semester.
This project creates a message networking application with a server-client architecture.

In this project, TCP sockets were utilized, and both server and client sides were implemented in C# to create a Windows Form Application.

On the client side, users can subscribe to channels and send/receive messages to/from those channels, and they can also unsubscribe, but they no longer receive messages coming from subscribed users.
On the server side, all the messages, online users, and the subscription and/or disconnection/shutdown statuses of users can be seen.
The disconnect/server shutdown paths have been properly implemented on both sides to avoid any crashes.
